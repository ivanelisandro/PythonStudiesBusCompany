<h2>Discounts</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Imagine you are at the stationery store. You want to buy a cheap pencil, so you are looking for discounts.  You have found some price labels. The first one is the standard price, the second one is a reduced price. You want to buy a pencil if the discount is more than 50%. </p>
<p>Write a function called <code class="java">discounts()</code> that takes two prices, the standard one and the discounted one. If the discount is more than 50%, <strong>return</strong> the message: <code class="java">"I will buy it!"</code>. If it is less, use the <code class="java">assert</code> keyword.</p>
<p>You do not need to take any input or call the function yourself.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
