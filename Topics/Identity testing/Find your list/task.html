<h2>Find your list</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>You play a game with your friends. You give them a non-empty list of integers and they create a list of lists, which contains your list and some other non-empty lists in some order. Your task is to find your list among other lists.</p>
<p>Complete the <code class="java">find_my_list(all_lists, my_list)</code> function,  where the first argument is the list of lists and the second argument is the list of integers that you should find. <code class="java">enumerate()</code> is the built-in function, which takes an iterable and returns its elements one by one along with their indexes. The function should return the position of <code class="java">my_list</code> in <code class="java">all_lists</code>. The lists in <code class="java">all_lists</code> are numbered from zero. It's guaranteed that an element exists in <code class="java">all_lists</code>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> There can be other lists that contain the same values as your list. You should find exactly your list, not a copy of it.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
